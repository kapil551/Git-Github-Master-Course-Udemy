    - Non-linear/branching (most important git feature)

    - By creating branches, you are not destroying the actual website, everyone is looking at the whole website, but you can create new branches and can work side by side on the new features as well.

    - git uses "hashing" for each each commit or each changes. 

    - git uses "MD5 Algorithm". 

    - git is written in language C.

    -

    - To check the git version:

        - git --version

    - To check folder directory:

        - pwd
    
    - To move to a directory:

        - cd Desktop
    
    - To view all files in a directory:

        - ls
    
    - Configure git:

        - Configuration of global variables:

            - git config --global user.name "Kapil Chaudhary"
            - git config --global user.email "chaudharikapil16@gmail.com"
        
        - We need to tell git that whenever we make changes then save this with this name and email.
